The design in which I have chosen works for both Uber and UberEats. The Ride class is essentially a log for the trip information. You can still store the customer's information in there, in the Passenger class. They technically won't be passengers, but the functionality is still the same.

The only thing that could be potentially wrong with my design are the names. There will be no passengers, but the customer will be the same thing. I could change the name to Customer, but then that could be confusing for the Uber side of things. The functionality would go as this:
    - The passenger would request a ride (which in this case would be a delivery)
    - The driver still accepts or rejects the ride (again, delivery)
    - if the customer doesn't have enough money the delivery is canceled and the driver is available for another pickup

It doesn't matter either way if it's UberEats or not, this design works regardless!
